      <p>This a love story that will never be understood by anyone except the woman i love and me. She is all i think about, day in, day out. She is the woman of my dreams. Dreams that seem so impossible that my eyes are blinded by tears of desperation. I have silently loved her for eight years. Strange enough, I have been married to her younger sister for almost the same period of time, and we have two beautiful boys. I should be in a happy marriage as many
 would expect, but the reality is that I love my wife's sister more than anyone
can imagine. I have always loved her, and I will always love her. I would do anything to be near her. We both understand that everything in this relationship is strange and unacceptable to many. Society will disagree with us but i don't care. I love her and she loves me and we both want to be with each other. We can't be together without hurting our families and I don't care. We only live once, and I want to live with her. </p>
